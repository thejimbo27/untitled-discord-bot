**Game Setup:**
`/new` - Create a new game in the current channel
`/join` - Join the current game in the channel
`/start` - Start the game with all joined players

**Gameplay:**
`/play` - Play a card from your hand
`/draw` - Draw a card from your deck
`/hand` - View your current hand

**Other:**
`/ping` - Check if the bot is responsive
`/help` - Show this help message

**How to Play:**
1. Use `/new` to create a game
2. Have other players join with `/join`
3. Start the game with `/start`
4. Players take turns playing cards that match either the color or number of the last played card
5. Special cards:
   - Skip: Skips the next player's turn
   - Reverse: Reverses the turn order
   - Draw 2: Makes the next player draw two cards
6. Use `/draw` if you can't play any cards
7. First player to empty their hand wins!
